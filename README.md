# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this assignment was to create an SQL managed database to help better organize and structure employee data. For the purposes of this specific analysis, the goal was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, as well as identify the number of employees eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results
- There are 133,776 records of employees with birth dates between January 1st, 1952 and December 31st, 1955, we assume these employees are of retirement age (some of these contain records of employees who have already retired, or duplicate records of employees who have held various titles during their tenure with the company (excel file here)).

- The role to be impacted the most due to retirement attrition is the Senior Engineer role with 29,414 of employees in this role at the age of retirement (excel file here)
- The role to have the fewest number of attritions due to retirement is the Manager role with only two employees at the age of retirement (however, the manager role has very few positions available so the loss of two managers may prove to have a significant impact)
- There are currently 1,549 employees still with the company who have a birth date between January 1st, 1965 and December 31st, 1965, these employees are considered eligible for the mentorip program (excel here)

## Summary 
As the silver tsunami takes impact there are about 72,458 employees that are still currently employed with the company, have birthday's between January 1st, 1952 and December 31st, 1955, and are therefore considered to be of retirement age. The below table shows the number of employees per each position that will be of the age of retirement.

The number of retirement ready employees that are qualified for the mentorship program are considerably lower than the number of employees that will begin to retire. Additionally, there are far less employees available for mentorship in in-demand roles such as Senior Engineer,
